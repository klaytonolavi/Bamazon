# Bamazon

The Bamazon shopping node application allows users to choose items from a mySQL database and make phony purchases to see the stock be updated
and to see their total price displayed. 

The user is asked to choose the ID of the product they would like to purchase.

The user is than prompted to choose how many of that item they would like to purchase.

After the user has chosen a quantity, the application calculates how much it will cost and display the price.
The application will then display a new table with the updated inventory minus the items the user purchased.

If the user tries to purchase too many of an item and there aren't enough of that item in stock, the user will get a message saying there is insufficient quantity.
